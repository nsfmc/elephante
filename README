# Elephanté

[elephanté](http://www.flickr.com/photos/subliminal/tags/elephante/) is a lightweight tumblr cache. It's not very smart, but it handles most situations pretty well.

It will return to you a php assoc. array that behaves identically to the tumblr api with the exception that it contains your whole blog's contents rather than *n posts* at a time.

## setup

    chmod 777 cache

it also uses php curl, which you may or may not need to install

## license

mit license
